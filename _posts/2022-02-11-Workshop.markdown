This year’s DSA event will be physical, starting on the 11<sup>th</sup> of May, 2023 hosted by the University of Rwanda located in Kigali City, Rwanda. We believe that the DSA community of both past and new participants can still benefit greatly from the event.

The DSA Kigali event will consist of oral presentations of data science applications from academia and industry and interactive panel discussions.

<!--The theme for the summer school is TBD. We want to improve the community engagement in Data Science in Africa, by empowering communities and researchers to consider their role in responsible AI practices in Africa. We strongly encourage the participation of data science communities from across the continent.-->
